# ICU_Alarm_Identification_Net

### Environment Configuration
If you want to run the project, first you need to install manually:
- pytorch=1.4
- numpy
- pandas
- wfdb
- prettytable
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tensorwatch
- tensorboardX
- torchsummary
- joblib
- ...(You need to supplement the unmentioned content according to the operation prompt)

### Train Model
Just modify the 'main_physionet2015.py' file as needed and execute it in the configured operating environment:

```python
# conda activate YOUR_ENVIRONMENT
python main_physionet2015.py
```

The trained model will be saved in the checkpoints folder, and the training log will be kept in the LOG folder.


### Evaluate Model
If you need to test in the sandbox provided by physionet2015, you need to manually install the operating environment in the sandbox.

Our ‘submit_entry’ folder provides some trained models and sandbox environment configuration scripts. Because the 'mkl-2020.1-217.conda' file is too large, we have moved it from the '/submit_entry/conda_pkgs/' folder to the '/data' folder. You need to manually download the file to the '/submit_entry/conda_pkgs/' folder, package the file in the directory into an 'entry.zip' file, and submit it to the physiont2015 sandbox environment to get the test result.
